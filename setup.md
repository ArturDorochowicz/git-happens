# Let's git to work

## Install git
Download and install git from [git-scm.org](http://git-scm.org/downloads)

You may already have it, as many packages include git these days. Type `git --version` at a command prompt to find out. 

If you're on a Mac and have homebrew installed, then `brew install git`.

## GUI client

`gitk` comes with git. This will let you view your commit tree.

gitx is fantastic for Mac (and free) but is not yet compatible with git 1.8.

Tower is lovely for Mac, but not free.

The Github apps for Mac and Windows provide an easy-peasy interface to git, but they abstract a lot of the functionality. Therefore, we prefer command line.


## Github

Create a [github](http://github.com) user. This will let you copy everyone else's repositories.

## Github pages

If you're planning to make or modify a github-pages site like this one, and you have Ruby, then get jekyll. `gem install jekyll`
